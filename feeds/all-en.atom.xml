&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you one of the biggest misconceptions aspiring data science newbies have nowadays. Real-world work is not something that the newbies think while studying in school. Unfortunately, you will surprise that the real-world projects give you a headache with data cleaning. In fact, 70%-80% of your time should just be collecting and cleaning data. You have to work with messy and unclean data. And, it is something that eventually becomes part of your routine work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>Python for Data Scientists</title><link href="%20https:/lucashomil.github.io/datascience/blog-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-13T10:20:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-13T10:20:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Lucas Ho</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-06-13: https:/lucashomil.github.io/datascience/blog-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;u&gt;Python for Data Scientists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In school, we could be provided datasets which are clean and spotless. For example, hackathons and Kaggle have a good database that we can download them and start working on the problem. Moreover, accuracy is not always the primary goal. Sometimes, you don’t really need a result as 1 plus 1 equal 2. Your boss just might want to know how you can optimize your algorithm for impact, not for the increasing of accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="python"></category></entry></feed>
