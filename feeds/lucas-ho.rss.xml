&lt;p&gt;The activation functions are responsible for transforming the summed weighted input from the node into the activation of the node or output for that input …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Lucas Ho</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 11:10:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2019-10-07: https:/lucashomil.github.io/datascience/blog-6.html</guid><category>python</category></item><item><title>PyPika - Python Query Builder</title><link>%20https:/lucashomil.github.io/datascience/blog-5.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to talk about another SQL topic - PyPika. Okay, What is PyPika?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, PyPika is a SQL query builder, which written in Python and doesn't limit the expressiveness of SQL. The advantages of PyPika are fast, expressive and flexible way to replace handwritten SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

Have you questioned if you have very large datasets, how can you deal with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we need a tool that is able to capably manage or interact with very large datasets.

Some of them may decrease the accuracy of models. In this blog, I am going to show you some automatic ways of selecting relevant features.
Imagine that you got a dataset with hundreds of features and you do not …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Lucas Ho</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 10:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2019-06-28: https:/lucashomil.github.io/datascience/blog-2.html</guid><category>python</category></item><item><title>Data Cleaning</title><link>%20https:/lucashomil.github.io/datascience/blog-1.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you one of the biggest misconceptions aspiring data science newbies have nowadays. Real-world work is not something that the newbies think while studying in school. Unfortunately, you will surprise that the real-world projects give you a headache with data cleaning.
