  <h1><u>Python for Data Scientists</u></h1>
<h3>Hello World</h3>
<p>Let me tell you one of the biggest misconceptions aspiring data science newbies have nowadays. Real-world work is not something that the newbies think while studying in school. Unfortunately, you will surprise that the real-world projects give you a headache with data cleaning. In fact, 70%-80% of your time should just be collecting and cleaning data. You have to work with messy and unclean data. And, it is something that eventually becomes part of your routine work.</p>
<p>In school, we could be provided datasets which are clean and spotless. For example, hackathons and Kaggle have a good database that we can download them and start working on the problem. Moreover, accuracy is not always the primary goal. Sometimes, you donâ€™t really need a result as 1 plus 1 equal 2. Your boss just might want to know how you can optimize your algorithm for impact, not for the increasing of accuracy. </p>
