# <u>Python for Data Scientists</u>

### Hello World. 

Let me tell you one of the biggest misconceptions aspiring data science newbies have nowadays. Real-world work is not something that the newbies think while studying in school. Unfortunately, you will surprise that the real-world projects give you a headache with data cleaning. In fact, 70%-80% of your time should just be collecting and cleaning data. You have to work with messy and unclean data. And, it is something that eventually becomes part of your routine work.

In school, we could be provided datasets which are clean and spotless. For example, hackathons and Kaggle have a good database that we can download them and start working on the problem. Moreover, accuracy is not always the primary goal. Sometimes, you don’t really need a result as 1 plus 1 equal 2. Your boss just might want to know how you can optimize your algorithm for impact, not for the increasing of accuracy.
