  <h1><u>Python for Data Scientists</u></h1>
<h3>Hello World.</h3>
<p>Let me tell you one of the biggest misconceptions aspiring data science newbies have nowadays. Real-world work is not something that the newbies think while studying in school. Unfortunately, you will surprise that the real-world projects give you a headache with data cleaning. In fact, 70%-80% of your time should just be collecting and cleaning data. You have to work with messy and unclean data. And, it is something that eventually becomes part of your routine work.</p>
